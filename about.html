            <h1>More About Me</h1>
            <span class="subtitle">Ozgur OZKAN / Cyber Security Enthusiast</span>
            <p class="about">
                This journey began with software; over time, my curiosity about
                cybersecurity, Linux, and system architectures drew me into this field. Despite this, I never strayed
                from software and continue to develop security-focused projects using <span class="accent">C++, Python, and Bash</span>.
                 I prefer to produce original projects rather than follow the paths taken by the majority.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since childhood, I have been a <span class="accent2">protective</span> person who enjoys
                <span class="accent2">supporting and guiding</span> others in areas where I have experience. When this
                aspect of my personality combined with my interest in cybersecurity, I realized I had found a field where I could both protect
                systems and contribute by advising people.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently, I work on <span class="accent">SOC operations</span>, <span class="accent">network
                    security</span>, log analysis, and threat monitoring; I practice on
                <span class="accent">Wazuh</span>, <span class="accent">OPNsense</span>, <span class="accent">Active
                    Directory</span>, and
                <span class="accent">Linux</span>. I also have a special interest in
                <span class="accent">Cloud Security</span> and aim to develop myself in this direction.
                <br>
                <br>
                My goal is to become a cybersecurity expert who not only uses tools but also
                <span class="signature">understands, analyzes, and develops the system</span>.
